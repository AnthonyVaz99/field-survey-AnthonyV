# Industry Survey report

## Professional Edition

In this report I will be going over the types of work I am interested in the future and their respective organizations, what credentials I may need or may be useful for that job, conventions or meetings regarding my area of interest, what I do/what my interests are in this field, any literature or media I see fit or appropriate for this report, as well as the current issues that we face in the area.


## Professional Organizations

* Argonne National Laboratory(ANL) - https://www.anl.gov/argonnes-science-and-technology
  
  - This is a company that I would very seriously consider working for. From their projects and research they do across the country to         their involvement in communities and how they tackle some of the biggest problems humanity faces is what peaked my interest in this         company.
 
    ## About Argonne
      - Mission Statement: "Driving scientific discovery to create technological advancements to protect and defend our nation against             current and future security threats."
      - Argonne's capabilities span 18 of the 24 institutional strengths that the Department of Energy defines for national laboratories,          providing a broad foundation for their work. "As we achieve our strategic goals for these capabilities, we will:"

    ## Careers at Argonne
      - Argonne has a very extensive list of careers available, a lot of them I could see myself getting with my degree. On top of that,           Argonne seems to have jobs available in most majorly developed states, so I shouldn't have too much trouble finding a position              regardless of where I am. This also provides flexibility in case I need to move to another state, I could probably just switch              facilities.
      - Their careers range from cyber security specialists, clean energy workforce, electrical engineering divisions -- and the list goes         on with more research/problem solving-based careers. With all of them I look at, there are really not many postions at this company         that I wouldn't consider having.
      - "At Argonne, we view the world from a different perspective. Our scientists and engineers conduct world-class research in clean            energy, the environment, technology, national security and more. We’re finding creative ways to prepare the world for a better              future."
      - Some of the programs Argonne has available:
        * Job applications open for both internal & external applicants
        * Extensive jobs for postdoctoral applicants
        * Undergraduate & Graduate Programs
        * Faculty programs to conduct research
          
    ## "Argonne in Chicago"
      - Argonne in Chicago is one of the many reasons that I would very seriously consider working for this company, it is an amazing              program aiming to give directly back to one of Americas longest struggling communities.
      - "Bringing the power of a national laboratory into communities is at the heart of Argonne National Laboratory’s second location             which resides within Chicago’s South Side Hyde Park community. Known as Argonne in Chicago, its mission is to drive inclusive               innovation that will help advance economic and societal impacts for underserved and under-represented communities."
      - Work in Chicago is aimed at delivering on four strategic goals:
        * Community Engagement: To extend benefits from Argonne’s capabilities and resources to disadvantaged communities
        * Science: To advance science and technology through expanded collaborations
        * Partnerships: To accelerate the transfer and adoption of technology by industry for U.S. economic prosperity
        * Workforce Development and Education: To build the workforce of the future to maintain U.S. competitiveness
      - Argonne in Chicago has been working with local community members, advocates and local officials to gain insights into community            needs and address issues. These collaborative efforts have already helped to launch several programs and initiatives to study               climate change, advance environmental justice and broaden STEM education and career opportunities.
